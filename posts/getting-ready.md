It has been almost a month since I created this site, and I am beginning my research journey into the fascinating world of computer science and engineering. I am particularly interested in exploring *artificial intelligence*, *computer vision*, *data structures* and even hardware. To unlock the full potential of these fields, I recognize that I need to gain a better understanding of essential topics, such as [``Python``](https://www.python.org/). Although I am a Sysadmin at TJ and I am surrounded by services that use ``Python`` such as [``Ion``](https://ion.tjhsst.edu/) and [``Director``](https://director.tjhsst.edu/), I have limited time to learn the language due to school work. Therefore, I am determined to make the most of my time and propel myself to the next level of knowledge.

Another L I have to take is the fact that most services that I want to use, like [``AWS``](https://aws.amazon.com/) for instance, requires some sort of payment to use their service. This is understandable, I mean...they can't just make their products free, why would they? This means that I have to scavenge the internet to check other places that have the similar service that ``AWS`` has.

The great thing about computer science is how open it is, meaning that you can literally find anything about computer science in the internet. There are probably millions if not billions of websites, videos, and articles that are available to all!

Here is a list of things that I'm good at, mainly things that I have proficiency on:
- Linux: I love Linux! It's open-sourced and it comes in a variety of distros and flavors which made me interested in this operating system last year! I have worked in many distros which included [``Ubuntu``](https://ubuntu.com/), [``Fedora``](https://getfedora.org/), [``Debian``](https://www.debian.org/), [``Kali``](https://www.kali.org/), and [``Arch``](https://archlinux.org/). I also have worked on the Linux command line so much, that I now mainly used it more often than the GUI!
- [``HTML``](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [``CSS``](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS#:~:text=Cascading%20Style%20Sheets%20(CSS)%20is,speech%2C%20or%20on%20other%20media.): These "languages" are one of the first I used and learned when I became interested in CS. I have a lot of experience with them, especally when it came to making websites back in middle school.
- ``Java``: The first ACTUAL programming language that I'm getting proficient on. I have gotten a lot of experience using ``Java``, mainly from my data structures class at my school, but I have coded many other side projects with them as well.
- ``Vim``: This is just here for fun. I use ``vim`` when I'm in a command line interface, and yes I choose this over ``nano`` and ``emacs``. It's just fun to use commands to write!
- ``Git``: Git is a version control system that allow people to make commits over time as to show the history of a file or repository. I use ``git`` a lot when it comes to pushing and pulling files from my ``gitlab`` or my ``github`` repositories.
- The command line: I metioned this before, but I'm completely transformed myself from using the GUI, to just writing commands on the command line. Why go through many sites to download something when you can just do ``sudo apt install <name-of-package>``?

Those are some things that I can do without even thinking, however something I think I would like to learn during my research journey:
- More Linux commands and distros: There are probably hundreds of distros in the the Linux ecosystem that may interest me in some way, and also have the privillage to learn more commands to increase my knowledge on the command line.
- Learn ``Python`` and other languages: ``Python`` is the most used and important language when it comes to AI, ML, CV, etc, so having proficiency in this language would be ideal.
- Data Science: This is a bit new to me as I'm just tipping my toes into [``R``](https://www.r-project.org/), a programming language decicated to statistics and data science. I think it would be cool to learn more about this topic of CS!
- Learn other things!: CS is going to lead me to explore other types of sciences and math, such as marine biology, astronomy, differental equations, linear algebra, etc.
- Have fun!: This is not really a learning target, but I think it is important to love learning what you are doing, so I'll make sure that there is something to be interested in!

I hope that this research journey goes well for me, and I hope that you are also intrested in the amazing research and findings that I'm about to uncover!
