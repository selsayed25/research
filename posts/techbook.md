I’m thrilled to introduce you to my web book, *The Techbook*, which is now live [here](https://selsayed25.github.io/techbook/). This project has been a labor of love, combining my passion for technology with a desire to make learning these complex topics more accessible. Here’s why I created *The Techbook* and what you can expect from it.

## Why *The Techbook*?

As a high school student with deep interest in computer science & engineering, I found that many resources were either too basic or too advanced for my level. I wanted to create a resource that bridges this gap, making it easier for beginners and intermediate learners to grasp essential tech concepts. *The Techbook* is designed to be a comprehensive yet approachable guide, covering a range of topics that are fundamental to understanding technology and computer science.

## What's Inside?

*The Techbook* covers a variety of important topics, each tailored to provide clear explanations and practical insights. As of July 31, 2024, the web book currently has chapters in:

- **Artificial Intelligence**
  - Machine Learning
    - Neural Networks
- **Data Structures**
  - Linear/Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Java**
- **Linux**
- **Python**
- **Web Development**
  - Back-End Development

## Why You Should Check It Out

*The Techbook* isn’t just a collection of technical information; it’s a resource designed with learners in mind. Here’s why you might find it valuable as a learner:

- **Comprehensive Content**: Each topic is covered in depth, with practical examples and exercises to reinforce learning.
- **Accessible Language**: The book aims to present complex concepts in a clear and understandable way, making it suitable for learners at various levels.

## What's More To Come?

Obviously the web book is not complete, it will take a while for me to get almost every type of tech knowledge from the world to this book. Currently I'm working on researching and learning more about:

- **Computer Engineering**: Such as digitial electronics, hardware fundementals, etc.
- **Mathematics**: I'll would like to add a chapter on calculus one day!
- **Computer Vision**: Just finished taking a course on computer vision at my high school, and I'm happy to start making pages on that!
- **Windows**: Why not? Learning about Powershell, Azure, and others wouldn't hurt?

...and so much more.

## How You Can Get Involved

I’d love for you to explore *The Techbook* and provide feedback. Your insights will help me improve and expand the content to better meet the needs of learners. If you have any suggestions or find any areas that could use more explanation, please let me know!

Thank you for your support, and I hope you find *The Techbook* to be a valuable resource in your learning journey as much as I had enjoying making the book. Feel free to share it with friends and others who might benefit from it.
